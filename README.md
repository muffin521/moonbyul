# Moonbyul
Moonbyul was a kpop gif bot designed to allow users to get gifs of their favourite idols directly into a Discord server. She was disconinued due to poor scaling capabilities and poor planning ahead, as well as the main library used (Discord.py) being discontinued and large changes being made to how message permissions are given on discord.

While she was a good starting project, she was never intended to scale and as such scaled poorly. With under a dozen original users, she scaled up to hundreds of users in under a year. Given the time constraints of first year engineering she was not given the attention needed to scale properly. She was a great opportunity to learn, and I hope to bring her back into use in the future.

## The Future
Moonbyul has been planned to come back after rewriting her in another language, likely Typescript. This project is on hold due to time constraints originating from university classes, engineering club, and work. The repository is currently private. It will make use of a proper database and more modular code, as well as better OOP principals.

##Thanks to:
Special thanks must be given to those who contributed gifs, made requests for new gif categories, feature requests, and helped sort through gif submissions. Additionally, Gareth and Aster for helping with actual problems in the code.
